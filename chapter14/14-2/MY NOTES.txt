That's not a problem. I realize something in mermi.py and gemi.py folder

there are difference them in terms of drawing shape on the screen. on 'mermi.py' folder to draw 
shape we need 'draw.rect fuctions'. when we look at 'gemi.py' folder to draw imgae we need to 'blit' method.
FOR ME this difference happen the result of we choiced image or occuring rect object. while,if you create rectangular 
you need to draw rect. for image that you loaded you need to blit method.

HOWEVER we use on 'blit method' and 'fill function' on 'buton.py' why we didn't use 'pygame.draw.rect' funtions?
for details please look at line 32 in buton.py
